# Hey there 👋
## 🚀 Projects

Here are a few selected bioinformatics and biotechnology projects I’ve worked on:

🔹 [CNS regeneration & Ankylosing Spondylitis Molecular Docking](https://github.com/thesaiprasadd/Bioinformatics-Projects)  
Dual study: PTEN inhibition for CNS regeneration and hub gene analysis in Ankylosing Spondylitis using GEO datasets, network clustering, and docking methods.

🔹 [Data Science - Coursera](https://github.com/thesaiprasadd/Data-Science-Coursera/tree/main)  
Created and maintained a GitHub repository as part of coursework, showcasing hands-on practice with Jupyter Notebooks and basic Python syntax.

Thank you <3
