## Hi there 👋
## 🚀 Projects

Here are a few selected bioinformatics and biotechnology projects I’ve worked on:

🔹 [CNS regeneration & Ankylosing Spondylitis Molecular Docking](https://github.com/thesaiprasadd/Bioinformatics-Projects)  
Dual study: PTEN inhibition for CNS regeneration and hub gene analysis in Ankylosing Spondylitis using GEO datasets, network clustering, and docking methods.

🔹 [Enzyme Characterization: sEH & CGTase](https://github.com/thesaiprasadd/Decoding-Enzymes)  
Exploration of two industrially significant enzymes—Soluble Epoxide Hydrolase and Cyclodextrin Glucanotransferase—covering structure, production, and applications.

🔹 [Chloramphenicol Production Workflow](https://github.com/thesaiprasadd/Chloramphenicol-Production)  
A detailed overview of biosynthetic and downstream processing steps involved in the industrial production of the antibiotic chloramphenicol.

🔹 [Biochemical Survey of Everyday Products](https://github.com/thesaiprasadd/Biomolecules)  
A survey-based study identifying biologically active compounds like proteins, enzymes, and vitamins in common food and personal care products.
